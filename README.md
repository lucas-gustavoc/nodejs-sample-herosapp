# Sample with Node.js and Express.js
An sample app aimed to show the basic structure for Node.js and Express.js web applications.

### Why Heros App?
Our goal here is to show you how Node.js can be a wonderful tool for many application. So we chose a crazy subject just to achieve this point.

    a. HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript with jQuery and JSON
    b. Node.js as server. See [Node.js home page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    c. Express as server framework. See [Express home page](http://expressjs.com/)
